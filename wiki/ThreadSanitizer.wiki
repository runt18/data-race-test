#summary ThreadSanitizer is an experimental Valgrind-based detector of data races

= Introduction =

*ThreadSanitizer* (aka *tsan*) is an experimental data race detector. 
It is similar to Helgrind in many ways, but it also has several 
differences (TODO). 


= Using ThreadSanitizer =
Just like any other valgrind-based tool: 
{{{
valgrind [valgrind options] --tool=tsan [tsan options] your/program [program options]
}}}

= Building ThreadSanitizer =
ThreadSanitizer is not a part of the official valgrind distribution, so you will 
have to download valgrind and ThreadSanitizer separately.

= Command line flags = 
|| --keep-history=0|1|2          || 1   ||  Keep the history of the previous accesses. <BR> Setting this option to zero will make the tool run 10%-30% faster, but will make the reports less informative. <BR> Use --keep-history=0 in continuous builds, and --keep-history=1 when analyzing reports. <BR> Values greater than 1 are experimental. ||
|| *Analysis sensitivity flags:* ||     || ThreadSanitizer can work in different modes that affect accuracy (number of detected bugs, number of false reports) and speed.||
||  --fast-mode=yes|no           || yes ||  Be faster, but miss some races. ||
||  --pure-happens-before=yes|no || no  || Act as a pure happens-before detector. Useful if you are testing a code which has a lot of custom not annotated synchronization (e.g. message passing. See also DynamicAnnotations (TODO)) ||
||  --ignore-in-dtor=yes|no      || yes || Ignore reports with a Destructor in stack trace. ||
||        *Interface flags:*     ||     ||      Flags that affect the generated output. ||
||  --color                      ||  no ||  Add colors to the output (uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). ||
||  --show-pc                    || no  || Show pc (program counter) in the stack traces. ||
||  --announce-threads           || no  || Show the the stack traces of thread creation . ||
||  --file_prefix_to_cut=file_prefix || ||   Remove "^.*file_prefix" from the printed file names.  You may pass this flag several times. ||
