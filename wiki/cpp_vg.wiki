#summary cpp_vg - an attempt to integrate C++/STL into valgrind

= Introduction =

We took valgrind sources and made few changes to make it tpossible to use C++ and STL in valgrind tools. 
For the source, see trunk/cpp_vg

= Details =
  # valgrind trunk rev 8843, VEX rev 1878
  # added libstdc++-v3 (gcc-4.3.2):
    * gcc-4.3.2/libstdc++-v3/include/ to include/m_stl
    * gcc-4.3.2/libstdc++-v3/src/ to coregrind/m_stl/src
  # added stlport (TODO(timurrrr): which version?)
  # added cppgrind - a simple C++/STL/Valgrind integration test

= How to try = 
Checkout: 
{{{
svn checkout http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpp_vg cpp_vg
}}}

Build:
{{{
cd cpp_vg
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/Inst
make -j install 

}}}

= TODOs =
  # copyrights in coregrind/m_stl/symbols.cc and cppgrind/cp_main.cc
  # more .cc's in coregrind/Makefile.am
