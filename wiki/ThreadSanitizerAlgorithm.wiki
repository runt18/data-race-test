*UNDER CONSTRUCTION!*

=Definitions=

*Tid* (thread id): a unique number identifying a thread of the running program.

*Addr* (address):  a pointer to the memory of the running program (a
    64-bit number on a 64-bit system).

*Event-Type*: one of  `Read`, `Write` (memory access events),
`Wrlock`, `Rdlock`, `Wrunlock`, `Rdunlock` (locking events),
`Signal`, `Wait` (happens-before events).

*Event*: a triple `{Event-Type, Tid, Addr}`. 
We will write `Event-Type(Tid,Addr)` or `Event-Type(Addr)` if `Tid` is obvious from the context.
