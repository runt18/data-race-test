=Simple example=

Let's consider the simplest example, test301 from RacecheckUnittest.
{{{
Mutex mu1;  // This Mutex guards var.
Mutex mu2;  // This Mutex is not related to var.
int   var;  // GUARDED_BY(mu1)

void Thread1() {  // Runs in thread named 'test-thread-1'.
  MutexLock lock(&mu1);  // Correct Mutex.
  var = 1; 
}

void Thread2() {  // Runs in thread named 'test-thread-2'.
  MutexLock lock(&mu2);  // Wrong Mutex.
  var = 2; 
}
}}}

You can run !ThreadSanitizer like this: 
{{{
valgrind --tool=tsan ./racecheck_unittest 301
}}}

The report (printed to stderr) will look like this:
{{{
